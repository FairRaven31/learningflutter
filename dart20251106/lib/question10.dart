// Write a function called operate that takes three parameters:
// An int a.
// An int b.
// A function operation that itself takes two ints and returns an int.
// The operate function should return the result of calling the operation function with a and b.
// Then, show how you would call operate using an anonymous function (a closure) to calculate the sum of 10 and 5.
