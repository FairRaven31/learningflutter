// Define a class called BasicMath.
// It should have no constructor.
// It should have two static methods:
// isEven(int number): Returns true if the number is even, false otherwise.
// average(double a, double b): Returns the average of the two numbers.
// Since the methods are static, you should be able to call them directly on the class 
// (e.g., BasicMath.isEven(4)) without creating an instance.
